		<h2>What is JUKEBOX?</h2>
			<p>JUKEBOX is a communal playlist website that is based on Spotify's API. Multiple people can queue songs to a single Spotify playlist instead of one person making the entire playlist or creating a group playlist ahead of time. JUKEBOX is meant to continously play songs that anybody can easily queue at anytime from their own accounts. If the queue finishes without another song being added, JUKEBOX will then play random songs so that the tunes never stop. JUKEBOX takes the tedious task of creating live playlists and streamlines it into an easy to use website.</p>
